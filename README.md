1. [Day 1](./day_1) – basic graph theory: dfs, topological sort, alien alphabet.
2. [Day 2](./day_2) – search: bfs, dijkstra, a-star.
3. [Day 3](./day_3) – trees: binary, balanced trees, avl tree.
4. [Day 4](./day_4) – hashing: hyper-log-log.
5. [Day 5](./day_5) - dynamic programming, longest sustring, spell checker, word breaker.
6. [Day 6](./day_6) – simple practical project.
7. [Questions](./QUESTIONS.md) - questions on Map-Reduce, DBMS, NoSQL and Scalability topics.
